### 1. Discuss your strategy and decisions implementing the application. Please, considertime
complexity, effort cost, technologies used and any other variable that you understand
important on your development process.

First I was not considering a production product, I just considered this app as a demo, so that's 
why I decided to use streamlit which is fast and practical to build demos. I also decided to use pandas
because it's easy to parse data and to do data manipulation. Also the csv was already in a good format, 
it was not necessary cleaning or data missing values treatment. Finally, the questions was simples
that was I decided to answer them with simple pie chart and tables with plotly.

My goal was not to complicate in any momement. Just build a simple app that answers the simple questions.

### 2. How would you change your solution to account forfuture columns that might be
requested, such as “Bill Voted On Date” or“Co-Sponsors”?

Because I'm using pandas and streamlit, adding new columns to the data frame is really simple,
as well as adding another visualization in the dashboard with streamlit would be easy as well

### 3. How would you change your solution if instead ofreceiving CSVs of data, you were given a
list of legislators or bills that you should generate a CSV for?

Not change much, just parse the list into a pandas dataframe and the solution will be the same


# 4. How long did you spend working on the assignment?
